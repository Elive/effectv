EffecTV 0.3.11

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
EffecTV is a real-time video effect processor. You can enjoy movies,
TV programs and any other video stream through the many amazing effects. 

INSTALL
=======

Requirements
------------
Currently, EffecTV highly depends upon the Intel architecture. It may not work
on any other platform.
EffecTV also works on PlayStation2. Please read "README.ps2".

Video capture card or USB device supported by video4linux is required.

EffecTV requires the SDL library, available from http://www.libsdl.org/.

EffecTV uses video4linux. Your kernel should be configured with 
CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV and enable drivers for your video capture card.

Bttv driver included in linux-2.2.18 is broken. Get latest bttv driver
from http://www.bytesex.org/bttv/.

Vloopback device driver is required for the video loopback feature.
You should use vloopback-0.91 or later.
http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/VideoFourLinuxLoopbackDevice

*NOTICE* If you uses libc-2.2.5, try latest patch kit or package for your
distro. Vloopback support does not work on early version of libc-2.2.5. If you
are Debian GNU/Linux user and installed "woody", install libc6_2.2.5-4 or
later.

NASM can be used to assemble some modules. See following URL:
http://nasm.sourceforge.net/
If you want not to use NASM, you have to modify "config.mk".

Compiling & installing
----------------------
Modify "config.mk" and "Makefile" (if necessary) and do

make

and

make install

Executable binary file "effectv" will be installed to /usr/local/bin/,
and man page "effectv.1" will be installed to /usr/local/man/man1/ by default.

The input device file (typically "/dev/video0") must be readable and writable
for you.

USING
=====

Before using
------------
Before starting up EffecTV, you should know about your hardwares settings.
* Video norm(NTSC, PAL, etc.) of your video camera or player
* Channel number of the Video source (this is different from channel numbers
  of TV stations)
* Video4linux device file name
You can adjust these settings with command line options. See the next section.

Synopsis
--------
effectv [options...] [effect name]

Options
-------
-device FILE
	Use device FILE for video4linux (default is /dev/video0).

-channel NUMBER
	Set channel number of video source (default is 0).
	If your video capturing device has multiple video source(TV,Video1,...),
	you may want to change this number to get correct images.

-norm {ntsc,pal,secam,pal-nc,pal-m,pal-n,ntsc-jp}
	Set video norm(signal format) of your video source (default is ntsc).

-freqtab {us-bcast,us-cable,us-cable-hrc,japan-bcast,japan-cable,europe-west,
          europe-east,italy,newzealand,australia,ireland,france,china-bcast,
          southafrica,argentina,canada-cable,australia-optus}
	Set frequency table of TV tuner. Choose one of them if you want to watch
	TV on EffecTV.

-fullscreen
	Launch EffecTV in fullscreen mode.

-hardware
	Use direct video memory (if possible). It makes EffecTV faster in some
	cases.

-doublebuffer
	Enable double buffering mode (if possible). It makes EffecTV faster in
	some cases.

-fps
	Show frames/sec on its title bar (X11 only).

-size WxH
	Set the size of capturing image. EffecTV can be slower when the size is
	larger. If you just want to get big (and not so fine) screen, please set
	"-scale".

-geometry WxH
	Set the size of screen. Usually "-scale" is a better way to change the
	size of screen. This option is for special purpose to stretch the
	screen.

-scale NUMBER
	Scaling the screen. "-scale 2" results 2x2 screen.

-autoplay NUMBER
	Changes effects automatically every NUMBER frames.

-palette {rgb24,rgb565,rgb555,yuv422,yuv422p,yuv420p,yuv411p,yuv410p,grey}
	Set the palette of capturing device. By default, it is detected
	automatically, so you need not to set this value. Some USB devices are
	very slow when it is used in RGB mode. Try YUV series if you feel your
	USB device is too slow.

-vloopback FILE
	Use device FILE for output of vloopback device.
	See "Recording/broadcasting EffecTV" section.

effect name
	EffecTV can be launched from any effect you want. Put an effect name
	after the command name ("effectv") or option(s). It's case-insensitive,
	and a trailing "TV" can be omitted.

Vloopback support - chaining/recording/broadcasting EffecTV
-----------------------------------------------------------
EffecTV has supported the use of a video loopback device since version 0.2.0.
First, install the vloopback module. See "REAME.vloopback" for the details.

Then, load the vloopback device driver module and verify the input/output
device files for the video pipe (typically /dev/video1 and /dev/video2).
Then, run EffecTV.

$ effectv -vloopback /dev/video1

The effected images can be read from /dev/video2. If you want to "chain"
a second instance of EffecTV, type as following.

$ effectv -device /dev/video2

For XawTv,

$ xawtv -c /dev/video2

To record the output to an MPEG file by using FFmpeg,

$ ffmpeg -vd /dev/video2 -s 320x240 effect.mpg

You can use many recording or broadcasting tools that supports v4l device.
Because vloopback does not support framebuffer I/O control, some tools don't
work. (e.g. streamer)

Maximum size of the output images is same as size of the screen. When required
size is smaller than the screen size, the output images are resized. Supported
palettes (pixel format) of output images are RGB32, RGB24, RGB565, RGB555,
YUV422, YUV422P and YUV420P.
