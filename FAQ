----------
Q1: I got a distorted/still/gray scale/shrunken image.

A: Check the signal format (the 'norm') of the video source; it will
most likely be either NTSC, PAL, SECAM, or one of their variants.  You
can then specify which format EffecTV should use with the "-norm"
option on the command line.  For example, when you have a video camera
which employs the PAL system, Try

$ effectv -norm pal

ntsc, pal, secam are supported by video4linux. pal-m, pal-n, pal-nc, ntsc-jp
are supported by latest bttv driver.
----------
Q2: TV seems to work fine, but how can I change to Composite1 or any other
video source?

A: Try
$ effectv -channel 1

Typically, meaning of the number is; 0=TV/1=Composite1/2=S-Video/3=Composite2.
This depends on the implementation of the video capturing card. Try several
numbers to detect the right one.

Since version 0.3.11, it is able to change the input channel by pressing 0-9
key with ALT key.
----------
Q3: Some effects do not work.

A: Older versions EffecTV employed gray scaled capturing mode that
some drivers do not support. Since version 0.3.0, color format is converted by
EffecTV core, so this problem was fixed. Please update your EffecTV to latest
version.
----------
Q4: EffecTV is frozen.

A: The bttv driver that comes with linux-2.2.18 is broken. Try the
latest bttv driver available at http://www.bytesex.org/bttv/.
----------
Q5: I tried the latest bttv driver(0.8.x) and EffecTV does not work.

Thank you, Malk.

Q6: Why don't you port EffecTV to ANY-GREAT-OS?

A: I want to do that if I could. But,
a) I have only linux machine and MS-Windows machine.
b) I dislike programming on MS-Windows.

I would like to encourage people who want to port EffecTV to another
environment; The whole CVS tree is now served at SourceForge. If you are
interested, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/effectv/. Please let me know
when you start your porting project, so that I can make a new CVS branch. If
you want to maintain the CVS tree directly, get an account at SourceForge and
tell me your ID. I will add your ID to the EffecTV developers group.

Q7: How can I capture the video output from EffecTV to harddisk?

A: EffecTV can output the processed images to a video loopback device since
version 0.2.0. First, you should download Jeroen Vreeken's vloopback driver
from http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/VideoFourLinuxLoopbackDevice
and install the module. Then, load the module and check the input and output
device files of the video pipe (typically /dev/video1 and /dev/video2). Finally,
run EffecTV.

$ effectv -vloopback /dev/video1

The processed images can be retrieved from /dev/video2. At the moment, EffecTV
does not support some pixel format, so some applications do not work.
----------
Q8: EffecTV is slow.

A: EffecTV uses a screen depth of 32 bits per pixel. When you launch EffecTV
on a screen with another depth, images are converted to that depth by SDL, and
it makes EffecTV a little slow. If you are using X11, try to run it in 32 bpp
depth mode.

If your video capturing device does not support 32bit pixel format, EffecTV
converts captured images to 32bit format. This also makes EffecTV slow.

Some USB devices become very slow when using RGB32 mode. Try to change the
palette to YUV series by using "-palette" option.
----------
Q9: I upgraded the Video4Linux driver(or the kernel) and I got error...

Since I update to the new Linux Kernel 2.4.6 I can't use my capture card with
EffecTV. When I try to start EffecTV, I get the following Error:

video_init: Can't find a supported pixel format.
Video initialization failed.

A: Since kernel 2.4.6, the most of Video4Linux driver output only its native
pixel format. Before 2.4.6, because drivers converted its native format to a
popular format supported by EffecTV, it had worked.
Since EffecTV-0.3.1, some pixel format converters were added, but it is not
completed yet.

If you got that error, try 'palettecheck' utility in 'tools' directory and
please send us the output with a bug report.
